# CPSC 223P Lab - 03 (Lists)

In this lab you will write a Python program that does a little list manipulation.  This exercise is intended to get you introduced to some of the simple concepts of lists.

# Requirements

Your software file will begin with two lists. It will be your job to combine the two lists and do a little manipulation.
1. The program shall print the length of the combined list (i.e. the number of list elements) as shown below
2. The program shall sort the list alphabetically, then use a loop to print all elements that start with a letter in the first half of the alphabet (i.e. 'a' through 'm') as shown below
3. The program shall reverse the order of the combined, sorted list and print the reversed list as shown below. **Important:** You are not allowed to use the reverse() built-in function. 

  > Example:  
  There are 20 elements in the combined list  
  Item 1  
  Item 2  
  Item 3  
  ...  
  Item m  
  ['Item n', 'Item n-1', 'Item n-2', ..., 'Item 1']
  

# Specification

First, download the project to your local workstation.  I recommend using a source code repository interface such as GitHub Desktop. Start with the template file called list_manipulation.py. Modify the header to include your own information, and update the code to meet the requirements. When you are satisfied with your changes, commit them to the repository.

After your code is committed to your GitHub repository, go to your account on GradeScope and find the assignment called Lab-03 - Lists. Under "Submission Method" select GitHub. You will need to point to the correct repository (called something like joates-223p-spring-2021/lab-03-_your user name_).  You may be asked to link your GitHub account with Gradescope at this time.  Next select the Main branch and press Upload. Gradescope will import your project files from GitHub and automatically grade them.  If you like what you see, you are done.  If not, you can make changes and use the Resumbit button on the bottom right of the Gradescope page to try again.
