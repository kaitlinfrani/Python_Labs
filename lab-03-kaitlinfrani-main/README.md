# Lab - 03 (Lists)

In this lab you will write a Python program that does a little list manipulation.  This exercise is intended to get you introduced to some of the simple concepts of lists.

# Requirements

Your software file will begin with two lists. It will be your job to combine the two lists and do a little manipulation.
1. The program shall print the length of the combined list (i.e. the number of list elements) as shown below
2. The program shall sort the list alphabetically, then use a loop to print all elements that start with a letter in the first half of the alphabet (i.e. 'a' through 'm') as shown below
3. The program shall reverse the order of the combined, sorted list and print the reversed list as shown below. **Important:** You are not allowed to use the reverse() built-in function. 

  > Example:  
  There are 20 elements in the combined list  
  Item 1  
  Item 2  
  Item 3  
  ...  
  Item m  
  ['Item n', 'Item n-1', 'Item n-2', ..., 'Item 1']
