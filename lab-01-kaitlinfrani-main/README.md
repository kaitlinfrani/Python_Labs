# CPSC 223P Lab - 01

In this lab you will write a simple Python program - the obligatory "Hello World" assignment.  This exercise is intended to get you started on your path to learning how 
to write significant programs in Python. Maybe more importantly it is inteded to help you set up your Git access.

# Requirements

The requirements for this one are simple. Your software shall update the template file provided so that it outputs the words "Hello, world!" to the console.  The text must match exactly to be given full credit.

# Specification

First, make sure you can download the project to your local workstation.  I recommend using a source code repository interface such as GitHub Desktop. 
Start with the template file called HelloConsole.py. Modify the header to include your own information, and update 
the code to print the famous words, "Hello, world!". When you are satisfied with your changes, commit them to the repository.

After your code is committed to your GitHub repository, go to your account on GradeScope and find the assignment called Hello World. Under "Submission Method" select GitHub. You will need to point to the correct repository (called something like joates-223p-spring-2021/lab-01-<your user name>).  You may be asked to link your GitHub account with Gradescope at this time.  Next select the Main branch and press Upload. Gradescope will import your project files from GitHub and automatically grade them.  If you like what you see, you are done.  If not, you can make changes and use the Resumbit button on the bottom right of the Gradescope page to try again.
